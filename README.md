# 💳 Credit Risk Prediction App

An interactive web app that predicts whether a customer is a **credit risk** (risky borrower) or not, using financial and demographic features. Built using **Streamlit**, **Scikit-learn**, and a well-crafted custom logic based on domain insights 🧠.

## 📂 Dataset

📊 Dataset used: [**German Credit Dataset (UCI / Kaggle)**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/german-credit/data)

Contains data of 1000 customers, labeled as **credit risk = 1 (risky)** or **0 (safe)**, based on 20+ financial and demographic attributes.

---

## ⚙️ How it Works

The app uses a **custom rule-based system** + a trained **Gradient Boosting Classifier** model.

### 🎯 Scoring Strategy

Each customer is scored based on:

- 💰 **Credit Amount vs Job Median**  
  High compared to peers → risky 📈  
  Low → safer 📉

- 💼 **Job Type**  
  Unskilled → risky 🚨  
  Skilled → neutral  
  Highly skilled → safer ✅

- 🏦 **Checking & Saving Accounts**  
  Low or missing → risky  
  Good savings → safer 💵

- 🏠 **Housing**  
  Renting → adds risk  
  Owning → reduces risk

- ⏳ **Loan Duration**  
  Long-term (>48 months) → risky  
  Short-term (<12 months) → safer

Based on the combined **risk score**, the model decides:

✅ **Safe Customer** → `CreditRisk = 0`  
⚠️ **Risky Customer** → `CreditRisk = 1`

## 💡 Recommendations

- Flag customers with **high credit amounts** or **long loan durations**.
- Automate initial risk scoring to **speed up approvals**.
- **Retrain model quarterly** to adjust for changing trends.
- Use risk score to **tailor interest rates** or **collateral requirements**.
